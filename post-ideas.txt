# So I've been doing something strange lately

What I've been doing lately is writing documentation. It's not something I've done a lot of and it's not something that I feel that I'm particularly good at. But lately I found myself writing a lot more of it. The reason for writing documentation is because I'm working in a code base that I'm not very familiar with and I'm making a lot of changes to that code base that could be very tricky for someone else to decipher.
This makes me think though that perhaps the best way to trick myself into writing documentation in the future is to try to picture myself in this moment.

working in a way where I could drop everything at a moment's notice (day's end) and have someone pick up tomorrow


# Cayleigh questioning her beliefs

a good thing since so often I've seen families stomp down any kind of questioning
she's more likely than most to say something that she thinks will please you instead of saying what she really feels


# Clayton playing Luigi's Mansion

might seem like a terrible idea, but it seems like it might be a really good way to manage anxiety
he was so afraid of the ghosts and the spiders. most of all I think he was afraid of failing
he's had so many difficulties with anxiety, it tends to trigger the worst
he had extreme moments where he had to pause and I almost thought he was going to hyperventilate
I had to remind him that it was just a game, nothing bad would happen if he failed


# Christianity and the cult of Trump

so many thoughts here
heard an episode on NPR
want to say not all Christians believe this way
too many do though
the internet and even Christians I might trust do not equal the Bible
I believe the Bible, not what someone claims is true without any evidence


# hero worship - why do we constantly look for heroes? (like Trump)

why I think literature like Dune and movies like Pitch Black with their anti-hero message are good
why I still think the Bible is good (there is only one hero - Christ. No one else will ever be like him or replace him.)
