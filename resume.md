# Software Engineer, Quicken Loans
## Detroit, MI — Jan 2019 — Present
Really enjoying working with a great team and with a wonderful group of people helping clients realize their dream of owning their own home.


# Senior Developer, E7 Solutions, LLC
## Troy, MI — Apr 2014 — Dec 2018
I had the opportunity to work on many different projects at E7. On some projects I assisted with development and architecture, on other projects I oversaw the entire process and reviewed the work directly with the client. Some highlights of projects I have worked on.
- **Shopify E-Commerce App** - built an app for the Shopify marketplace allowing the client's customers to integrate their Shopify stores with the client's marketplace. Planned, architected and developed the application using the Django framework and leveraged AWS services like RDS, SQS and Elastic Beanstalk. Assisted the client in setting up the application to run inside containers.
- **Dental E-Commerce** – helped a client migrate from their existing E-Commerce platform to a more robust one built on top of OroCommerce. Assisted with planning, migration, and customization of the platform.
- **Financial E-Learning** – developed a custom application so the client could build an internal portal to manage and promote continued education within their organization. Utilized Angular v1 and Sharepoint 2010 for content.
- **Automotive Manufacturing** - several applications supporting a client in the automotive industry. Primarily an Angular v1 application with several RESTful servers written in Java with Spring.
- **E-Learning Courses and Editor** - built several Angular v1 applications managed with Grunt (and in two cases Gulp) tasks. Additionally developed a custom course editor on Electron Shell to allow the client to build out their own courses.
- **Dental E-Commerce Prototype** - rapidly developed a prototype consumer facing dental e-commerce platform. An Angular v1 application with a RESTful server written in Python with Django.
- **Automotive E-Learning** - developed several informational Angular v1 sites for a client in the automotive industry. The client wished to manage content changes through the HTML so we leveraged Angular’s Directives to allow this without disrupting the features they had requested.
- **Automotive E-Learning Search Enhancement** – enhanced the application above by utilizing the Sharepoint 2016 search api and translating search results to pages within the Angular v1 application.

# Application Development Manager, North American Bancard
## Troy, MI — Jan 2012 — Mar 2014
I worked closely with upper management during this time to develop structure for the growing IT development department. I helped define and implement the structure and processes that enabled the development teams to work together and with the rest of the organization. Below are some additional highlights from that time period.
- Directly managed a team of 10 developers with differing skill sets.
- Oversaw more than 216 releases of more than 20 applications.
- Added new tools and procedures to the team's development cycle. The tools, procedures and lessons learned were also later used to set standard procedures for the rest of the development group.
- In addition to overseeing application development and release I have acted on several cases as both a project manager and business analyst due to shortages in those areas.
- Heavily involved in an aggressive IT hiring spree. I developed a tool to help track candidates and interviews along with new procedures that helped everyone keep up with the influx.

**Tools Used:** Jira, Confluence, Crucible, Stash, Bamboo, PHP, GIT, Subversion, Python, Apache, HTML, Javascript, Symfony2, Composer and Postgresql.

# Web Application Developer, North American Bancard
## Troy, MI — July 2009 — Jan 2012
In this role I built, and often architected, several applications to support external and internal objectives. During this process I worked directly with various departments inside the organization since we did not have Business Analysts or Project Managers at that time. Below are some key achievements from this period.
- Improved communication and collaboration by introducing Redmine, a project management application, into our development routine which helped documentation and quality control. This reduced duplicated effort saving valuable time and resources. (Prior to this there was no ticketing system.)
- Created a file import management suite to organize our many data imports and bring early warning of failures to IT’s attention.
- Helped to migrate application deployment to a consistent, subversion based version control system.
- Helped to train coworkers on using development tools including but not limited to: subversion, netbeans, xdebug, and webgrind.
- Deployed and managed a Jenkins continuous integration server to ensure code quality. Trained coworkers on automated unit and integration testing.
